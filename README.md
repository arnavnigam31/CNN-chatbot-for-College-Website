# Chatbot with CNN

This project is a chatbot implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for intent classification. It uses the `intents.json` file to learn and respond to user inputs based on predefined patterns and responses.

## Project Structure

- `intents.json`: Contains the training data for the chatbot, including patterns, responses, and tags.
- `new.py`: The main script that loads the data, trains the model, and provides a function for getting responses from the chatbot.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
